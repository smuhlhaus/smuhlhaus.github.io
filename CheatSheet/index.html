      <h2>The Rules</h2>
    <p>
      The purpose behind this table it to list, explain and demonstrate the
      different position attributes and properties an element can have. In the
      below table I have given all examples their own property while including a
      top: 20px rule to see how it affects element. Additionally, absolute was
      given a background colour of white, z-index of 1 and opacity of 0.9 to
      better acknowledge its location before scrolling.
    </p>

        <tr>
          <th>Static</th>
          <td>
            Default value. The element is positioned according to the normal
            flow of the document

          <td>
            In normal flow of document, but then offset from itself based on the
            values. Space is still created for the element.

            Element is removed from normal flow of page and no space created for
            the element. Positioned relative to closest ancestor or otherwise
            containing block.
          </td>
          <td>top, right, bottom, left, z-index</td>
          <td class="absolute eg">Absolute</td>
          <td>
            Element moves 20px down from top of page and stays in that specific
            location, can be hidden with scroll.

          <td class="fixed eg">Fixed</td>
          <td>
            Like Absolute, Fixed comes down 20px from top of page, but is pinned
            on that point regardless of scroll. Used for nav bars.

            scrolling ancestor and block.
